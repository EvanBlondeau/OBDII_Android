-How can i use this asset on my assets, like a Car Controller?
  [Gauge System]
    First of all you have to add a Gauge System object.
    Then customize it if you want, set the dimension type to Two Dimensional (2D) or Three Dimensional (3D), and set the gauge type to Analog or Digital.
    And enable colors and sizes and positions to be overriden.
    And let's say we want to make a speedometer gauge..
  [Gauge Target]
    Add the Gauge Target on the car that you want to use.
    Then in Targets click + button, and in the Name field write a name like Speed.
    And in the Gauge field put the gauge object into it, and in Target field put your Car Controller script into it.
    Then in Value Name write speed, and in Maximum Value Name write topSpeed, note that you should write the correct name of the variable, including uppercase and lowercase letters and without any spaces.
    So now you have to set how many numbers or big lines with texts you want to display.
    In Values click + button and put a number in the fields, for example if your top speed is 100, then we can add [0 , 25 , 50 , 75 and 100]
    And you're done, press Play and enjoy.
